# Hello, I'm Kristian! <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px">
I am a Software Engineering student at Bournemouth University in the UK.
I enjoy building programs, mostly web applications (so far). I also like spending my time on coding projects and learning about new technologies through online articles and videos.
